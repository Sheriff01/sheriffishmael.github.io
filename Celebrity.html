  Those who see ourselves as global citizens are not abandoning other identities; such as allegiances to our countries,  <span class="read-more-target">ethnicities, and political beliefs. These traditional identities give meaning to our lives and will continue to help shape who we are. However, as a result of living in a globalized world, we find we have an added layer of responsibility. We have concern and a share of responsibility for what is happening to the planet as a whole, and we are members of a world-wide community of people who share this concern.</span></p>
