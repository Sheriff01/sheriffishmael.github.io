      <p>I am currently pursuing an associate degree in Computer Science; however, I also plan to pursue a bachelor’s degree in a four-year university if I get the financial support. It is my utmost dream and goal to get a bachelor’s degree in Computer Science and a PhD in the future. I want be educated to the fullest because no one in my family has ever finish high school or travel outside of Sierra Leone. So, I want to be the first, be a role model to the younger ones and support them financial to get educated.  I am pursuing a degree in Computer Science because I have always love computers and curious how they are made.  Therefore, I want become a computer scientist.  I want to be a computer scientist not only to make computers, but to be able to produce computers that consume very limited amount of energy and are environmental friendly too. Moreover, I also want to make computers that are very sophisticated with modern technologies which will aid disable people like the blind, deaf, dumb and more.  In addition, I also want to make those computers very cheap so that even the poor people can afford to get one. However, I am very certain that if I do not complete my two years’ associate degree at North Lake College, I will not have the golden opportunity to achieve my career goals and dreams. </p>
